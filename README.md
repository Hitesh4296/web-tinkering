## Features

- This will likely never have a feature "FEATURE"

## Demos

- HTML Streaming with Suspense, Await and loaderData
- HTTP Streaming with Server Sent Events
- Animated Text with Framer Motion
- React Scan, hopefully optimising rerendering practices and maybe fixing some old practices

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev

# converts to
react-router dev & npx react-scan@latest localhost:5173 # assuming you run on the default ports
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
